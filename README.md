## ⚡Fun Facts
☕ I love debugging—it’s like solving a puzzle.

🎮 I enjoy coding challenges and hackathons; they keep my problem-solving skills sharp.

💡 I often refactor my old code just for fun (and sometimes regret it).

🚀 I get excited about optimizing algorithms, even if no one else cares.

🛠️ My idea of a "weekend project" usually turns into an all-night coding session.
